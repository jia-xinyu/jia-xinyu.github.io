Hi, I'm Xinyu Jia (贾鑫宇 in Chinese), currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at the [Biorobotics Lab](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/bme/bioroboticslab/) within the `National University of Singapore` (NUS), under the guidance of Prof. [Haoyong Yu](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/bme/bioroboticslab/author/haoyong-yu/). My doctoral research focuses on `motion planning` and `motion control` of high-degree-of-freedom robots such as `robotic arms` and `legged robots`.

Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Vehicle Engineering from [Jilin University](https://auto.jlu.edu.cn/EN/Home.htm), Changchun, China, in 2018. After that, I worked as a Mechanical Engineer at Shenzhen [DJI](https://www.dji.com/) Technology Co.,Ltd., China, from 2018 to 2020, where I contributed to the development of automous vehicles. 

I'm a tech enthusiast in the realms of racecars, robotics, and rocketry. You can explore some of the [projects](https://jia-xinyu.github.io/projects/) I've been involved in. I thrive on collaborating with talented guys to develop innovative products.

In my spare time, I enjoy hitting the gym and engaging in exterme outdoor sports. My ultimate dream is to travel the world as a backpacker. Exciting adventures await!
