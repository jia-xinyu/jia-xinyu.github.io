Hi, I'm Xinyu Jia (贾鑫宇 in Chinese), currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at the [Biorobotics Lab](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/bme/bioroboticslab/) within the National University of Singapore (NUS), under the guidance of Prof. [Haoyong Yu](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/bme/bioroboticslab/author/haoyong-yu/). My doctoral research focuses on **motion planning** and **motion control** of high-degree-of-freedom robots, such as robotic arms and legged robots.

Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Vehicle Engineering from [Jilin University](https://auto.jlu.edu.cn/EN/Home.htm) (JLU), Changchun, China, in 2018. At JLU, I joined the [Gspeed Formula Racing Team](https://baike.baidu.com/item/吉林大学吉速方程式车队/23156065) for [Formula SAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_SAE) in China (2015-2018). After that, I worked as a Mechanical Engineer at Shenzhen [DJI](https://www.dji.com/) Technology Co.,Ltd., China, where I was involved in the R&D of autonomous driving (2018-2020). 

I'm a tech enthusiast in the realms of racecars, robotics, and rocketry. Some of my projects can be found [here](https://jia-xinyu.github.io/projects/). I thrive on collaborating with talented guys to develop innovative products. Welcom to discuss with me about **mechanics**, **electronics**, **software**, **algorithms**, etc.!

In my spare time, I enjoy hitting the gym and engaging in exterme outdoor sports. My ultimate dream is to travel the world as a backpacker. Exciting adventures await!
