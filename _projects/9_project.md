Based on the previous [robotic project](https://jia-xinyu.github.io/projects/8_project/), we developed a 12-degree-of-freedom (DoF) collaborative robot (**cobot**) in 2022. It has a pair of force-controlled robotic arms, each equipped with a gripper.

The robotic arm is mounted on the body with an inclination of **45Â°** to avoid singularity near frequently used configurations.

We design several sizes of grippers for different scenerios. Their fingers are underactuated and assembled with **tactile sensors**. For more information, please refer to my colleague Haotian Guo's [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9793603).

The robot also has eyes (ZED 2 stereo camera) and a 2-DoF neck (DYNAMIXEL MX-106R motor). In fact, the robot has a similar configuration to its [predecessor](https://jia-xinyu.github.io/projects/8_project/) in terms of **electronics** and **software**.

We validate the control algorithm in **CoppeliaSim** simulation and on real hardware. More demo videos are in preparation.
