In 2017, I served as the technical lead of the [Gspeed Formula Racing Team](https://baike.baidu.com/item/吉林大学吉速方程式车队/23156065) (Gspeed). Meanwhile, I was responsible for developing the entire chassis of Gspeed 2017, including suspension, steering, braking and transmission systems.

Inspired by Formula One (F1), we introduced the [3rd-spring](https://optimumg.com/tech-tip-springs-dampers-part-three/) technology in Gspeed 2017. It can decouple the chassis's longitudinal and lateral movements, improving the handling stability in the two directions, which was validated in Adams/Car simulations.

The maneuver of the full vehicle under transient and steady conditions was studied too. The virtual prototype was verified in some standard experiments, such as the [skidpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skidpad), and was also "driven" on the 1:1 Xiangyang circuit!

In addition to rich simulations, we invested much effort in real hardware experiments and obtained a lot of valuable data.

In 2017, I witnessed the growth of an excellent R&D team (approximately **100 people**) and proudly worked with every member.

In Oct 2017, the Gspeed race car was shipped to Xiangyang circuit for [Formula Student China](http://www.formulastudent.com.cn/) (FSC) 2017, where there were 72 domestic universities to pariciapte in. We finally won the **6th place (1st prize) of overall events**, **2nd place of static events**, and **1st place in Engineering Design**.

The advisor Prof. [WAND Da](https://auto.jlu.edu.cn/info/1152/2821.htm) and I received the award. The team put much thought into Gspeed 2017 and deserved this award.
