In 2017, I served as the **technical leader** of the [Gspeed Formula Racing Team](https://space.bilibili.com/403011009?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0) (Gspeed). Meanwhile, I was responsible for developing the entire **chassis** of Gspeed 2017, including suspension, steering, braking, and transmission systems.

Inspired by Formula One (F1), we introduced the [3rd-spring](https://optimumg.com/tech-tip-springs-dampers-part-three/) technology in Gspeed 2017. It decoupled the chassis's longitudinal and lateral movements to improve handling stability in the two directions, which was validated in Adams/Car simulations.

The full vehicle maneuver under both transient and steady conditions was also studied. The perfomance of the new virtual prototype was validated through standard tests, such as the [skidpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skidpad). Additionally, we "drove" it on the Xiangyang circuit in simulation.

In addition to extensive simulations, we invested much effort in real hardware experiments and obtained a lot of valuable data.

In 2017, I witnessed the growth of an excellent R&D team (approximately **100 people**) and proudly worked with every member.

In Nov 2017, the car was transported to the Xiangyang circuit for [Formula Student China](http://www.formulastudent.com.cn/) (FSC) 2017, which was attended by 72 domestic universities. We finally won a **1st place** in Engineering Design, a **2nd place** in static events, and a **6th place (1st prize) overall**.

The team advisor Prof. [Da WANG](https://auto.jlu.edu.cn/info/1731/6693.htm) and I together received the award. The team put much thought into Gspeed 2017 and deserved this honor.
