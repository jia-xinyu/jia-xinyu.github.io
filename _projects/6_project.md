After graduating in the summer of 2018, I worked as a Mechanical Engineer at Shenzhen [DJI](https://www.dji.com/) Technology Co., Ltd., where I participated in hardware development for autonomous driving, including a stereo camera and an electronic control unit (ECU). During my time at DJI, I had two **patents** as follows: 
* [WO2020198945A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2020198945A1/en) / CN111225831B (vehicle sensor module)
* [WO2022016339A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2022016339A1/en) / CN113728734A (vehicle control system)

In spare time, I enjoyed flying DJI drones on Shenzhen beaches. Look at these beautiful landscapes!

I also took the drones to western Sichuan Province in China in May 2020 and had an unforgettable road trip.
