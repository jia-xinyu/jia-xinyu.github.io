**Motion Planning**

We are developing a high-frequency model predictive controller (**MPC**) with obstacle avoidance capabilities. It's almost done!

**Motion Control**

We have developed several **efficient** and **robust** motion controllers for robots with high degrees of freedom. Please see our publications {% cite tmech_2024 icra_2024 %}. We will be delighted if the algorithm could be deployed in your robots.
