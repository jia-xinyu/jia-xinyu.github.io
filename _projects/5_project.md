In 2018, I served as a consultant of the [Gspeed Formula Racing Team](https://baike.baidu.com/item/吉林大学吉速方程式车队/23156065) (Gspeed), providing technical support for the R&D of our combustion car (Gspeed 2018-C) and electric car ([Gspeed 2018-E](https://jia-xinyu.github.io/projects/4_project/)). 

Thanks to all Gspeed members, we won the **championship** in [Formula Student Combustion China]((http://www.formulastudent.com.cn/))(FSCC) 2018!

One of the big upgrades this season was the new powertrain. The predecessor Honda CBR600F four-cylinder engine with a 1.65bar turbocharger was replaced by **a KTM 690 Duke** single-cylinder engine with **a 300cc supercharger**. To this end, we designed a new set of intake, exhust, boost, fuel, cooling, and electronic systems. The new powertrain has a max power of **60kW** and can maintain **82Nm** torque output within a wide speed range (**2500~6000r/min**). What incredible data!

Simuntaneously, we developed a new braking system with ventilated discs. Brake cooling performance has been greatly improved.

In terms of the chassis, we upgraded the [3rd-spring](https://optimumg.com/tech-tip-springs-dampers-part-three/) suspension system for better vehicle handling stability.

During development, we took the driver into account in simulation, while continuing to conduct many real hardware experiments.

I graduated from Gspeed in the summer of 2018, though I was very reluctant to leave the team.

In Oct 2018, the car was transported to the Xiangyang circuit for FSCC 2018, which was attended by 66 domestic universities. We finally won the **championship** as well as many awards in the sub-events. This is the first championship in the history of Gspeed!

At this point, my story in Gspeed was paused. However, the Gspeed's story continues. There are more advanced technologies being developed and applied to our race cars, such as the carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFPR) **monocoque** of Gspeed 2019-C.
