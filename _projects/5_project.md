In 2018, I served as a consultant for [Gspeed](https://baike.baidu.com/item/吉林大学吉速方程式车队/23156065), providing technical support for the combustion race car development (Gspeed 2018-C). Thanks to all team members, we won the **championship** in [Formula Student Combustion China](http://www.formulastudent.com.cn/) (FSCC) 2018!

One of the major upgrades this season was the new powertrain. The predecessor, a Honda CBR600F four-cylinder engine with a 1.65bar turbocharger, was replaced by a **KTM 690 Duke** single-cylinder engine with a 300cc **supercharger**. For this new engine, we designed a completely new set of intake, exhust, boost, fuel, cooling, and electronic systems. The new powertrain had a max power of **60kW** and can maintain **82Nm** torque output across a wide speed range (**2500~6000r/min**). What incredible data!

In terms of the chassis, we developed a new braking system with ventilated discs. Brake cooling performance was greatly improved.

And we upgraded the [3rd-spring](https://optimumg.com/tech-tip-springs-dampers-part-three/) suspension system for better vehicle handling stability.

During the development, we took into account the driver behavior in simulation, and continued to conduct many real hardware experiments.

I graduated from Gspeed in the summer of 2018, though I was very reluctant to leave the team.

In Oct 2018, the car was transported to the Xiangyang circuit for [FSCC](http://www.formulastudent.com.cn/) 2018, which was attended by 66 domestic universities. After a week of competition, we won the **first championship** in Gspeed history! All awards we received are listed below:

* **1st place overall** (Champion)
* **3rd place** in Cost & Manufacturing Analysis
* **1st place** in Engineering Design
* **3rd place** in Acceleration
* **2nd place** in Autocross
* **2nd place** in Endurance
* **Fastest lap** in Endurance
* **1st place** in Lightweighting
* **1st prize** in ANSYS Simulation

More importantly, we received funding to represent China in [Formula Studen Germany](https://www.formulastudent.de/fsg/) (FSG) 2019!

At this point, my journey with Gspeed paused. However, Gspeed’s story continues. More advanced technologies are developed and applied to race cars, such as the carbon-fiber-reinforced-polymer ([CFRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber_reinforced_polymer)) **monocoque** in Gspeed 2019-C.
