In the 2016 season, I was promoted to the suspension group leader and was responsible for the development of the [Gspeed](https://baike.baidu.com/item/吉林大学吉速方程式车队/23156065) suspension system.

We simulated the suspension in Adams/Car software to ensure the vehicle has excellent **handling stability**. After that, the layout of new suspension system (i.e., hardpoints) was basically determined.

When designing components, we apply the finite element method (FEM) in ANSYS software to optimize their shapes, weight and load performance.

How exquisite are these mechanical parts on Gspeed 2016!

During development, we also conducted several experiments to verify the actual performance of the components. For example, we used DP460 adhesive to attach carbon fiber wishones to aluminum joints. In the failure test, the bonded interface was not destroyed until the tensile force reached an astonishing **36.83kN**!

The completed suspension was installed on the car with other systems. We were very proud of this work and captured many beautiful photos.

In addition to gaining more expertise, I also learned how to manage a group of R&D staff this year.

In Oct 2016, the Gspeed race car was shipped to Xiangyang circuit for [Formula Student China](http://www.formulastudent.com.cn/) (FSC) 2016. A total of 69 domestic universities participated, and our team finally won the **2nd prize**.
